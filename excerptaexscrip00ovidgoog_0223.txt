Cnnwus wasthe sou of Agenor,ki of Phoenicia. Jupiter, husin,
transformed himself into a bull, preva' edon Europa, the sister of thir
prince, to get on his back, and immediately plunging into the sca, hs
carried her across it into Crete. Agenor, ignorant of the fate of hia
daughter, and disconsolate at her loss, ordered Cadmus to go in search
of Europa, with a command not to return to Phoenicia till hehad
found her. The pursuit of Cadmus was fruitless. He could hear ns
tidings of his sister, aud not dariug to return to his native land with .
out her, he resolved to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, thet he
mi ht know in what art of the earth to fix his abode. ,

'lte oracle directe him to follow aheifer, which was deseribedto ·
him, and wherever she should lie down, there to build a city, aud to ’-
call the country Boeotia. Cadmus soon found the heifer,and pot
himself under her guidance3 she at length lay 'down near the bauli
of the river Cephisus, where he prepared to* commence the city
according to the directions of the oracle. Here the present account
begins. The spot isa little north of Attica. Cadmus is supposed to
have come into Greeoe A.c.1493‚and to have bro ht with him
the use of letters, and the worship of many of the gyptian und
l'hoenician divinities.
