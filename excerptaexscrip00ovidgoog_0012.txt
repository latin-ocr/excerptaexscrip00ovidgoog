PREFACE.

—u—

Ia prepanug this little volume from the writings of ovid, great
care has been taken to admit nothing in the slighteet degree indel-
icate or improper for the study of youth Sufficiant attention
does not appear to have been prid to this point in the selectione
from Ovid which have commonly been used in schools.

One object has been to furnish examples of the different kinds
ff masura used hy this polished and fascinating writer. Itis not
a little surprising, that in the whole course of studies preparatory
for, and pursued at our colleges, not averse of Pentameter meas·
ure occurs* There are a few lines of the Elegiae measure in
the Collectanea Graeca Minora, which formerly served as a text,
wherehy to explain this measure3 hut since the exclusion of that
excellent hook from the requisitions for entrance, nothing of the
kind remains, either of Greek or Latin, in the whole course. y

Thieisthe more surprising, since, inadditiontothe frequency with
which this kind of versification occurs, it may be considered one of
the most easy and gracesul which the ancient pects used.

As this hook is designed for a kind of introduction tc fabulous
history, the notes give amore full account of the subjecte connect·
ed with the matter immediately under consideration, than might
otherwise seem expedient And this is the more necessary from
che circumstance, that boys are not usually intrusted with a Classi-
cal Dictionary at so early an age as this hook will probably he

''l'lrere may be exceptione to this remark, although there is none within
the writer's knowledge,
