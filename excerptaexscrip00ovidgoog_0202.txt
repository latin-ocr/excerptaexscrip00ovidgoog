——-—-.-—.

fidu< 1.

Pussros Ovinius Niso, a celebrated Roman poet, was born at ’
Sulmo, a town of the Peligni, about forty years before the Christian
era. His parents were of equestrian rank, and educated their son for
the bar, buthe soon forsoolr this and every other pursuit for the
cultivation of poetry, and at length became one os the most admired
and emineat poets in the court of Augustus. His prosperity was,
however, of short continuance. Having mcurred, by some unknown
offense, the dis leasure of the emperor, he was banished to Tomos, a
town near the hurino sea; where, aster many ineffectual attempts to
obtain the pardon of Augustus he ended his da s, in the ei hth year
of hisflbamshment, and the fidy-ninth year of his age. The poetry
of Ovrd has long been celebrated forits variety, sweetness, and
eleganoe. But the frequent violations of modesty, which disgrace
some parts of his writings, detraot much t'rom the merit of this gifted
poet. His Metamorphoses, though not thelmost finisbed of his oems,
