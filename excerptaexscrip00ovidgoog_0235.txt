594. Ora: the head os Medusa, one of the three Gorgone, the
daughters of the sea deities Phorcys, or Phorcus, and Ceto. Of these
sisters Medusa alone was subject to mortalit . As a punishment for

by striking the earth with his foot, he raised the fountain Hippocrene,
which was sacred to the Muses, and hasbeen much celebrated hythe
