sndcompelled to undertake the perilous enterprisos, which have n
denominated the twelae labore os Hercules. Alter these and many
other dan crs, which the enmity of luno brought upon him, had been
successsufiy encountered, Heroides went to Calydon ιο the court os
OEneus, king of Etolia, and became one of the suitors of his daughter
Dejanira, who had been promised in marriage tn the hero, who should

him for the prise, in the contest which ensued ; but finding himself
inferior to his ο cuent in strength, he had recourse to stratagem, aad

wrestling with himin the latter s ape, Hercules wrong off one os his
horns; and the loss so filled Achelous with chame and humiliation,
that he submitted to his adversary, and was immediatel changed into
ariver. To console him sor this defeat, the horn, which he had lost,
was taken up by the Nattdes, and filled by the goddess of Plenty with
the fruitsof autumn, and received the name of Cornucopia, or the
Hom of Plenty. Returning from AEtolis in triumph with his bride,

Centaur Nessus, who engaged to carry her in safety to the other side
of the river. No sooner, however, had he arrived with her on the op·
