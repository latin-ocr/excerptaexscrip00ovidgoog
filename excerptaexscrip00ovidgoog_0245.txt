The harmony,1n which Medea asterwards lived woh Jason, was at
length interrupted. Forgettin the great obligations and the fidelity
which he owed to her, Jason dnsook Medea, and married Creusa or
' Glauce, the dau hter of Creon, kin of Corinth. His injured wisc

immediately rescived on revenge, and by means of her magioal aits,

she set fire to the palace of Creon, and destroyed him and his da hter
in the flames. The exasperated Jason hastened to punish the enc ant·
ress, but when he appeared in her presence, aster reproaching him for

his ingratitudo, she murdered before his eyes two of their children,
and then fled through the air in a chariot drawn by two dragous to
Athens. Here she married the king Egens, by whom she had a
son called Medus. Atter having attempted to poison Theseus, she
was obli ed to fly from Athens, and passed the remainder of her
days witi her son, in that part of Asia which bears his name. It is,
however, said by some mythologists, that she was at length reconciled
to Jason, and died at Colchis.

tus.
